# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Social-Media-Data-using-BERT
This project performs Sentiment Analysis using a dataset containing social media posts 
with 15 columns, which include textual data, sentiment labels, timestamps, 
usernames, social media platforms, hashtags and other demographic information.  
The primary goal is to classify each recordâ€™s sentiment label into one of the three major 
categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. I perform the classification using 
transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) like BERT.
This Academic project was implemented as part of the course CIS 660 Data Mining at Cleveland State University in Fall'24 Semester
